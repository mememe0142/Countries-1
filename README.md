# Countries

A fork of [FreeIPTV](https://github.com/Free-IPTV) / [Countries](https://github.com/Free-IPTV/Countries), free for everyone, and without the hate.

## Usage

Simply open [https://thelastzombie.github.io/Countries/ZZ_PLAYLIST_ALL_TV.m3u](https://thelastzombie.github.io/Countries/ZZ_PLAYLIST_ALL_TV.m3u) with your preferred media player and you're good to go.

For specific countries or radio stations, replace `ZZ_PLAYLIST_ALL_TV.m3u` with the file name of one of the other M3U playlists listed in [TheLastZombie](https://github.com/TheLastZombie) / [Countries](https://github.com/TheLastZombie/Countries).

## Contributions

I will not maintain this repository. Feel free to send pull requests, though these should preferably go towards [iptv-org](https://github.com/iptv-org) / [iptv](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv) instead.
